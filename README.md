# Slow-Ugly-HashTable
HashTable I made that's extremly slow and doesn't work at all but I made it when trying to implement it into another project I was working on. Never got it done yet and I have it so much. So I'm sharing it with you

# Please don't use this Hashtable it doesn't work. 

Again, it's part of a project I'm working on but I later scrapped it. This could be used for learning purposes but it doesn't work how a HashTable works at all.
